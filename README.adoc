TURNUS plugins for link:https://www.gephi.org[Gephi] (the opensource graphs visualization platform). link:https://gephi.github.io/tutorials/gephi-tutorial-quick_start.pdf[Here] you can find a nice quick-start tutorial for Gephi in order to immediately start visualizing your exectution trace graphs!

## The Execution Trace Importer
This plugin is a Gephi file importer for the execution trace graph generated using TURNUS. The latest plugin release is available link:http://scistimm.epfl.ch/turnus/addons/gephi/turnus-gephi-importer-plugin-2.1.0.nbm[here].

To import a **.trace** or a  **.tracez** file in Gephi go:

----
File -> Open
----

and select your execution trace graph file. 
Two option tabs are available to define some import options: 

Dependencies::
As illustrated in the picture belowe, the set of dependencies to be imported is proposed:
* **FSM**: check this box if you want to load all the FSM dependencies.
* **Guard**: check this box if you want to load all the guard dependencies (i.e. enable/disable).
* **Port**: check this box if you want to load all the port dependencies (i.e. input/ouput).
* **Internal variable**: check this box if you want to load all the internal variable dependencies (i.e. read/read, read/write, write/read, write/write).
* **Tokens**: check this box if you want to load all the tokens dependencies.
* **Unknown**: check this box if you want to load all the uncategorized dependencies.

Loading options::
As illustrated in the picture belowe, it is possible to load the execution trace graph as a vertex graph and limit the number of loaded firings:
* **Load as vertex graph**: check this box if you want to load the execution trace graph as a vertex graph. Firings and dependencies will be represented both as a vertex.
* **Limit the number of loaded firings**: check this box if you want to load a limited number of firings. An option tab where set this number will be prompted.

### Supported Gephi versions
This plugin supports the latest **0.8.2-beta** version of Gephi.

## How to install a plugin in Gephi
Download on your disk the latest plugin release and save it on your disk. Then from Gephi follow:

----
Tools -> Plugins -> Downloaded -> Add Plugin
----
and select the file that you just downloaded. Follow the instructions and you have done: your plugin is now installed!

Memory available to Gephi is determined by Java. It is possible that for very-big execution trace graphs Gephi will run out-of memory. Less or more memory can be allocated by configuring the Gephiâ€™s startup settings as described  link:https://gephi.github.io/users/install/#memory[here]. 

## Only for developers
When Gephi is run from link:http://netbeans.org/[NetBeans] it does not appear to use the correct settings for the heap memory (xmx xms etc.). You need to overwrite these settings in the directory where you have the gephi source-code 
`/submodules/gephi-plugins/nbproject/project.properties` as described in the following:

----
run.args.extra=-J-Xms256m -J-Xmx8g
----
